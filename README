MUSTARD README
==============

This is the official repository for the development of MUSTARD,
the Mapped Uniform System for Tracking Architecture, Requirements
and Design.


Dependencies
------------

In order to use MUSTARD, you'll need the following components:

  * Python >= 2.6
  * PyYAML
  * python-markdown
  * python-bottle
  * pygit2 (and libgit2)

Most of the dependencies should be available in your distro, apart from
libgit2 and pygit2. The section below explains how to install these two
easily.


Installing pygit2
-----------------

If you lack pygit2 in your distribution, the safest way to get it is to
prepare a statically built libgit2 in a temporary installation location
and then link pygit2 against that.  Since libgit2 is not API/ABI stable
yet, this will innoculate you against others installing different
versions of libgit2 at other times.  It won't save you from incompatible
pygit2 installs, but you can fiddle with python paths if you care about
that.

To build libgit2 statically and pygit2 with that, do the following:

    $ mkdir pygit-building
    $ cd pygit-building
    $ git clone git://github.com/libgit2/libgit2.git
    $ git clone git://github.com/libgit2/pygit2.git
    $ cd libgit2
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOLEAN=OFF \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(pwd)/install ..
    $ make
    $ make install DESTDIR=""
    $ cd ../../pygit2
    $ LIBGIT2="$(pwd)/../libgit2/build/install" python setup.py build
    $ sudo python setup.py install

This will install pygit2 into /usr/local -- obviously you can tweak the
`setup.py` invocations if you wish to alter where it installs to.
